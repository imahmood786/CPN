4. **Case Study: Composability Verification of an Elevator Model**

In this section, we provide the details of the case study of an elevator model. We assume the elevator which servers 6 floors. For the sake of simplicity and reduced space, we initialize each floor with 3-4 passengers (though the actual model is capable of taking a large number of incoming passengers). The following steps demonstrate the composability verification process of the elevator model.

4.1 **Requirement Specification**

We define RS = 〈**O1, S1〉** where

 Objective **O1** **= {**All the arrived passengers must reach their destination floor**}**

Constraint **S1** **= {**The door should never be opened when the elevator is moving**}**
